      title: 'Abstract',
      content: `The use of fossil fuels for energy generation has led to significant pollution and depletion of natural resources. One of the main barriers to the adoption of renewable energy, particularly photovoltaic (PV) cells, is their low efficiency, especially in urban environments. In cities, the presence of tall buildings and crowded neighbourhoods often creates shadows, reducing the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed. To address this challenge, this project focuses on determining the maximum solar energy potential of building surfaces in urban areas. It aims to identify optimal and suboptimal locations for placing PV cells. The solution utilises satellite imagery from sources like Landsat or Cartosat, combined with shadow simulations based on building heights and the sun's position. By utilising date, time, and Global Horizontal Irradiation data, we visualise the real-time energy potential on city models. This tool helps both builders and owners of existing structures to harness the maximum solar potential for their buildings.`

      title: 'Introduction',
      content: `In today's world of Rapid Development, the rise of energy consumption has massively been on the rise. In 2024, India stands as one of the top global CO2 emitters with a value of 2.88 billion metric tons. The massive upscale in demand for renewable energy and drive towards low carbon energy sources have led to an investment into photovoltaic solar energy facilities.`
